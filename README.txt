Setup: 
Drag and drop OpenHarmonizerM4L~.amxd, OpenHarmonizerMIDIM4L.amxd, and OpenHarmonizerVoiceM4L~.maxpat into a folder that is included in your Max path. Alternatively, add a new path by finding the Max menu bar and clicking Options->File Preferences, clicking the + in the bottom left, and then clicking the "choose" button in the new row that appears. Selecting the folder that you've saved the OpenHarmonizer files into will make them visible to Max. It may be necessary to restart Max and/or Ableton Live after this point, but this will only need to be done the first time you use OpenHarmonizer. 


Use: 
1. Place an OpenHarmonizerMIDIM4L.amxd device on an empty, armed MIDI track in your Ableton Live session. 

2. Then, place an OpenHarmonizerM4L~.amxd device on an armed audio track. It is important that both tracks are armed. 

3. Sing and play your MIDI device simultaneously! You should hear vocal harmonies based on the notes you play.
